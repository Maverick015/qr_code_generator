Very simplistic QR Code Generator

As mentioned above, this is a very simple QR Code Generator.

Though it is simple, it does not lack features!

It manages a wide range of sizes, of pixel density, and even allows the user to round the corners of the QR Code!

Isn't it fantastic?

All found possible errors are currently fixed, therefore avoiding tracebacks.

P.S : You can also NAME your QR Code, which is going to be the File name. Wow!
